# Framework7.d.ts
Typescript definitions for Framework7, Swiper, Dom7 by iDangero.us

Note: this is not good for v1 really anymore, probably.  This is just the code before my start to v3 which will inhabit the master branch.  I never got anything good for v2.

I did the best I could off the documentation so far, but I made some guesses and probably many errors.  Better than nothing!

As I understand it to work, maintaining this in the centralized @typings registry is more trouble than I'm willing to set up.  But you can still install it pretty easily like this:

```
npm install https://github.com/JasonKleban/Framework7.d.ts
```
